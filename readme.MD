This application is intended to be used with cx1e2e: https://github.com/cxpsemea/cx1e2e 

cx1e2e-tracker has two main use-cases:
- providing a historical context for successful test durations
- allowing comparison of two specific test reports

It does so by consuming the JSON-format reports generated by cx1e2e.

# Historical mode

The following parameters are relevant for historical mode:

```
cx1e2e-tracker.exe:
  -avg-pct uint
        Output a warning when test duration exceeds historical average by this percentage (default 15)
  -history string
        Cx1e2e-tracker history file generated by this program (default "cx1e2e-history.json")
  -max-pct uint
        Output a warning when test duration exceeds historical maximum by this percentage (default 15)
  -report string
        Cx1e2e JSON report file generated by cx1e2e (default "cx1e2e_result.json")
```

A normal invocation could look like:
```
cx1e2e-tracker.exe -report cx1e2e_result.json -history cx1e2e-history.json
```

In this mode, the history file (cx1e2e-history.json) is generated and, in subsequent executions, read & updated to contain a running tally of the average and maximum durations for sucessfull (PASS) tests in the report file (cx1e2e_result.json). When test results listed in the report have durations exceeding the average or maximum durations in the history file, a warning is generated. This can be used to identify tests that are still passing successfully, but are taking longer than expected.

Example output:
```

```


## Comparison mode
```
cx1e2e-tracker.exe:
  -cmp-pct uint
        When comparing two reports, hide tests that have durations that differ by less than this percentage (default 15)
  -compare string
        Cx1e2e JSON report file generated by cx1e2e to compare against (default "cx1e2e_result2.json")
  -report string
        Cx1e2e JSON report file generated by cx1e2e (default "cx1e2e_result.json")
```

A normal invocation could look like:
```
cx1e2e-tracker.exe -report cx1e2e_result.json -compare cx1e2e_result2.json
```

In this mode, the test details from both reports are compared, and a table is printed showing the tests, the PASS/FAIL/SKIP status and duration for both reports, along with a percentage difference between the test durations. 

Example output:
```

```

The output omits tests which were skipped in both reports.
